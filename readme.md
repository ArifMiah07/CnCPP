# C/C++


C was my first programming languages. Syntax of C is really touches me although solving problem or writing a program is hard at the beginning compare to high level language but i think its totally normal using C, as time goes on expectation from developer is getting kind of crazy high with time and effort so i think we should move or stay on C/C++ (Im not saying to make website's ui/ux using C) to slow down building process it will make our society more stable and will work as a shield against 'Super Massive AI Hype';
